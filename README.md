# garfish-wasm-esm-plugin

Garfish plugin for running `<script type="module">` resources through a browser
WebAssembly transformer. The wasm core uses OXC to parse ESM syntax and rewrites
imports/exports into the Garfish runtime helpers.

## Usage

```ts
import Garfish from 'garfish';
import { GarfishEsModule } from 'garfish-wasm-esm-plugin';

Garfish.run({
  plugins: [
    GarfishEsModule(),
  ],
});
```

The plugin only handles scripts that Garfish already marks as module scripts.
For Vite-style sub applications, keep using an HTML entry with
`<script type="module">`.

## Build

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

`pnpm build` first runs `wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir pkg`, then builds
the TypeScript Garfish wrapper into `dist`.

## Vite Example

```sh
pnpm example:dev
```

The example starts a Garfish host page that loads `subapp.html` as an HTML entry
with a `<script type="module">` sub application. It imports this package through
the local source alias so changes in `src/` can be exercised without publishing.

## Release

This package uses Changesets. Add a changeset for user-facing package changes:

```sh
pnpm changeset
```

GitHub Actions expects an `NPM_TOKEN` repository secret with permission to publish
`garfish-wasm-esm-plugin` to npm.

When a same-repository PR includes a releasable changeset, CI consumes that
changeset in the runner workspace and publishes a beta package with the npm
`beta` dist tag. The beta version format is:

```text
<next-version>-pr-<pr-number>-<utc-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS>
```

When the PR is merged into `master`, CI consumes the changeset, commits the
version/changelog metadata, publishes the formal npm package with the default
dist tag, then pushes the release commit and tags back to `master`.
